# global_gamers_challenge

## General Idea
Quest based game where you work in a "sustainable guild" where you have to take on quests which engage in positive environmental action, building your character to challenge the quest easier.

## Main Interface
2 main components: Variable interface and character statistics.

## Character Statistics
Information about the current character:
- Character Experience
- Character Coins/Money

## Menu Based Interface with multiple tabs
3 Main Tabs:
- Missions Tab: List of missions that give rewards (Experience)
- Shop Tab: List of items user can buy that makes missions easier/increases reward
- Equipment Tab: List of items user own and can equip

## Google Wallet Integration (Subject to change)
Making Donations To X Charity will plant Trees (Another Tab). Trees can either be cosmetic or can provide buffs like items.

## Minigames
Accessed in the missions tab, each given specific rewards (Experience and Coins). Minigames should promote environmentally positive actions. Potential examples:
- Sorting Garbage and recycling
- Turning Off Lights
- Planting Trees

Each Minigame should have a time limit and a score system. The score should convert to levels of reward. Each game should be drag and drop type games (Playable on every platform without lots of overhead on control). Currently, we should aim to have 10+ minigames.

## Estimated Schedule
- 1st Week: Complete Main interface and some minigames
- 2nd Week: Create Rough drafts for Games
- 3rd Week: Polish the games draft/Potentially Google Wallet integration
- 4th Week: Tackling Additions for the competition (See judging criteria), getting submission ready
- 5th Week: Submitting/Fixing Bugs/Polishing
